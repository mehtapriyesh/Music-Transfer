# Music-Transfer
I had been using Saavn for ages and had a well built playlist in that. 
But, after advent of Spotify in India I preferred playing songs in that. 
This repository will show how I first imported a list of songs from a playlist in Saavn using beautiful soup then add all those songs to a new playlist in Spotify using Selenium Python.
